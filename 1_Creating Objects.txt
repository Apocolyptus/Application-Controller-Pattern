#Creating Objects#

This is what will be used to create an object, it dictates what information should be passed to the object (if any) at the time
of its creation and is the first thing that is called when an object is created. There can be multiple constructors for a single
object.

A constructor must have the same name as the class that it is in (i.e. if you created a Car class you must have your
constructors name be Car too).

If there is more then one constructor for a class they must not have the same header (i.e. you can't have two constructors in
the same class with the header public Car(), they must be different).

The access specifier is what determines what code can see and use this specific constructor, there are three values it can be,
public, private and protected. Public means that code that is outside of the constructors class can see and use it. Private
means only code inside of the constructors class can see and use it. 

After the access specifier you must type the constructors name (remember the constructors name must be the same as the class
name) followed by a pair of parenthesis. These parenthesis can be left blank or contain Parameters. If a constructor contains a
parameter you must declare the parameters data type followed by the name of the parameter. If a constructor contains 2 or more
parameters you must declare the data type and name for each parameter, even if the parameters are of the same type (i.e. you
can't do the following public Rectangle(Double w, h) as it will cause an error).
